#1. Create a class called Human
#2. Add an attribute leg_count with the value of 4
#3. Add another attribute can_walk with value of True
#4. Optionally you can instantiate the class and prints out the leg_count and can_walk attributes


class Human:

    leg_count = 4
    can_walk = True

    def __int__(self, name):
        self.leg_count + self.can_walk

girl = Human()

print("leg count:", girl.leg_count, "\b" " can girl walk?:", girl.can_walk )
